          <p>Then you can enter both here to see if it's in the game.
            Another advantage is that the search display near matches as well, which may surface useful substitutes if the brick you want is not available in-game yet.

          <p>If you still cannot find your brick, don't hesitate to ask on discord in <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1089294229899051028/1089296197254135832">#help</a> or on reddit using the `Help Me Find A Part ðŸ”Ž` flair!
            <!--If you want a brick added to the game, consider sumbitting it to Bricks Wanted - a list of community-requested bricks for the developpers to add.-->
