### BFC and Harlequin geometries

See sample_view.htm for how to implement toggleable BFC and Harlequin geometries for part views. Make sure LDRBFCGeometries.js is included after LDRGeometries.js and use LDR.setMode() to set the type of geometry to generate. All geometries will have to be regenerated after changing the mode.
